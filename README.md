The project itself was deployed and can be viewed [here]()

## Overview  

We are in the process of developing an auction website where numerous sellers can list their products for bidding. Users will have the opportunity to place bids on these items within a specified time frame. At the End of the auction period, the product will be awarded to the bidder with the highest offer.
